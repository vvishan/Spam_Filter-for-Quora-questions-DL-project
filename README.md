# Spam_Filter-for-Quora-questions-DL-project

# Goal : 
Build a model for identifying if a question on Quora is spam 

Project objective
-----------------
* Train machine learning algorithm to distinguish between spam and ham text messages that are pre-labelled.   
* Learn NLP basics (DONE), to deal with large datasets (DONE) and deep learning algorithms/packages in Python in a practical context. 
* Email marketing is an enormous part of your overall digital marketing success. However, “how to avoid spam filters” is a question that can often thwart your efforts. The fact is, over 20 percent of email marketing messages never make it to their destination (a recipient’s inbox). The major reason for this is spam filters, which score emails and reject ones with too high a risk score.
* Ultimately spam filters exist to save consumers from endless streams of unwanted, fake mail. As marketers, we often have a love-hate relationship with the parameters but learning how to avoid spam filters will help us get our message to the right people.

# Practices:
Good practice includes testing your emails before sending them will help to ensure that your important marketing messages are getting through properly, and also sending emails to clean purchased contact lists without fear that emails won’t get through.


# Suggested : 

1. To bring down dimensions of your model you can use glove embedding shared with you ( in the data )

2. Here is how you can use pertained embeddings : https://blog.keras.io/using-pre-trained-word-embeddings-in-a-keras-model.html
